<br>
<h2>Pre Open Source versions</h2>
<hr><i> 16 September  2013</i>
An error in the protection levels of negative cells values has been solved. <br>
The treatment of the protection levels is now also consistent in modular, audit and CTA.<br>
The procedure to handle the singleton protection in modular was not correct, when there were negative cells.<br>
This could lead to unexpected failures in the protection. This has been corrected as well.<br>
As a consequence there could be slight deviations in the results.
<hr><i>15 April 2013</i>
Problems using &tau;-ARGUS on Win7 in combination with CPlex have been solved. No longer administration rights required.<br>
The singleton protection options are now also available for the full-optimisation model.
<hr><i>26 February 2013</i>
The options for writing output have been extended.<br>
An error using CPlex has been solved.
<hr><i>19 November 2012</i>
The distance function is now available as an alternative cost-function.
<hr><i>7 November 2012</i>
The missing=safe option was not handled correctly after a global recoding. Has been solved.
<hr><i>27 August 2012</i>
The singleton procedure in the Hypercube can now be activated optionally.
By default it is activated if there is a frequency available (always when the table has been created from microdata, but not always if the input is ready-made tables).<br>
Interactively the option is available in the GHMiter options window.<br>
In batch the GH command has been extended:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>GH(TabNo, A priori Bounds Percentage, ModelSize, ApplySingleton)</i>;  ApplySingleton = 1 equals yes, 0 equals no.
In batch writing the JJ-file is now possible (option 5)
<hr><i>29 July 2012</i>
The procedure to compute the protection levels gave incorrect results for negative cell values. Has been corrected.<br>
In batch the sensitivity rules could give wrong results when the TopN values were used.
<hr><i>31 May 2012</i>
An error in the procedure to make a table additive has been corrected.
<hr><i>27 February 2012</i>
The singleton-protection did not work properly when using the linked tables in batch.
The default settings were used and not the specification in the .ARB file
<hr><i>22 February 2012</i>
The distance function is now also available for linked tables
<hr><i>25 January 2012</i>
Linked tables has an error when in one table the corresponding variable was hierarchical and in the other not. Has been corrected.
<hr><i>24 January 2012</i>
In batch creating multiple tables from a microdata file caused a problem. Has been corrected.
<hr><i>12 January 2012</i>
The code for the total-category can be chosen by the user, also when computing tables from microdata<br>
In linked tables a similar cell can be present in different tables. Inconsistencies are to be avoided.
A small report (Inconsistent.txt) is now created in the temp-directory and reported in the log-file.
<hr><i>13 December 2011</i>
The linked tables option could fail unexpectedly. It has been corrected.
<hr><i>25 November  2011</i>
The installation procedure of Build 10 failed. <br>
An error in reading a batch-file with microdata-input failed. Has been corrected.
<hr><i>17 November  2011</i>
An error in the table vi ewer, when switching from a 2-dim to a 1 dim table has been solved.
<hr><i>17 November  2011</i>
When introducing the new singleton option, some overprotection was introduced by too much backtracking.
This has been corrected in this build.
<!--8 dimensional tables can be computed. However no protection is possible.-->
<hr><i>5 October  2011</i>
Linked tables is now possible in batch.
Also the linked tables procedure is mentioned in the report.<br>
An update in the singletons procedure has been implemented. During the backtracking procedure the suppressed marginals are not considered as primaries when applying the singleton procedure. This avoids some overprotection. More details see the Tarragona paper.
<hr><i>2 September 2011</i>
Linked tables when using fixed format microdata is now possible.
<hr><i>21 June 2011</i>
Some minor errors in linked tables have been removed.
The SBS-output now also acknowledges the p%-rule (F-flag).
<hr><i>9 May 2011</i>
This is the first release of &tau;-ARGUS 3.5.<br>
Linked tables with modular is now possible<br>
When a set of tables can be seen as a subset of a larger cover table, this set can now be protected.
It is a restriction that the cover table has not more than 4 dimensions.
The problem can also be solved using the hypercube. <br>
An updated version of the manual is also available.
<hr><i>26 April 2011</i>
A new approach for protecting the singletons has been implemented in modular and optimal.<br>
No longer the protection levels are increased to force additional suppressions for protecting the singletons,
but artificial cells (a combination of 2 singletons, a singleton and a multiple
or a group of cells not meeting the sensitivity rules) are added to the problem.
These artificial cells get a minimal protection level.<br>
This will reduce the over-protection caused by the previous solution.
<hr><i>10 February 2011</i>
The computation of the protection levels for very small cells could cause problems. If the prot. level became less than 1 a minimum of 1 was substituted. This has been replaced by the smallest non-zero that can be printed  given the precision of the cell values. So if two decimals are used for the response variable this minimum is now 0.01.<br>
A cancel button has been added at the first windows after calling Hypercube, Modular or Optimal.
<hr><i>1 February 2011</i>
In the apriory file an option has been introduced to apply a change to all cells that are equal by definition. In hierarchies often trivial levels are present. This option guarantees the consistency of a table.
<hr><i>21 January 2011</i>
An error reading tables in batch (introduced in B18) has been corrected.
<hr><i>7 January 2011</i>
If the minimum cell value is non-negative, the minimum cell value is no longer asked before suppression.
Always a 0 is assumed.
<hr><i>3 January 2011</i>
When applying apriory information via an apriory file, inconsistencies might be introduced.
This could happen if certain cells in a trivial breakdown in a hierarchy will be assigned a different status.
An additional option is introduced such that a change is applied to all cells that are implicitly the same.
<hr><i>16 December 2010</i>
In the report file only summary of the results of a apriori file is presented.<br>
The details are presented is a sub -report, accessible via a link.<br>
In case of multiple apriori files all information is presented.
<hr><i>30 September 2010:</i>
